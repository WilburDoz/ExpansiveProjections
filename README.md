# ExpansiveProjections
What kind of decision boundaries can a shallow expansive neural network (like a simplified nose) capture?

A quick description of the files:
1) April6thDecisionsBoundaryIV - runs one simulation, set the parameters and let it go!
2) Perceptron Weight - calculates the optimal perceptron weights
3) Create Distribution - creates the initial data by a few different schemes
4) Threshold - applies the non-linearity in a few different ways
5) Plotter - plots a few bits of analysis on the data
